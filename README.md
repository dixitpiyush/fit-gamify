# FitGamify

In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle can be a challenge. FitGamify emerges as a groundbreaking solution, bridging the gap between fitness and entertainment. This innovative platform is designed to transform the way we approach exercise, creating a unique and engaging experience for users of all fitness levels.

_Note: This project was created as a Minor Project for the fulfillment of Master of Computer Applications course from Manipal University Jaipur. You can check out the [Project Report](<./Minor%20Project%20Report%20(MUJ%20MCA)%20[FitGamify].pdf>) for the same._

## What does Gamification mean here?

At the heart of FitGamify is a point-based scoring system that gamifies the fitness journey. By completing exercises and achieving daily goals, users earn points. These points not only motivate users to stay consistent with their workout routines but also unlock prestigious "Fire Badges," displayed on their profiles as a testament to their dedication. But FitGamify doesn't stop at individual accomplishments; it thrives on the power of community and competition. Users can join groups, competing with friends and fellow fitness enthusiasts. At the end of each week, the top performers are rewarded with gold, silver, and bronze badges, creating an atmosphere of healthy rivalry and mutual encouragement.
